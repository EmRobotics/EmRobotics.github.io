**Research Overview**

Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is a vital therapeutic approach utilized for young patients suffering from central nervous system disorders such as medulloblastoma. The task of accurately outlining the treatment area is particularly time-consuming due to the presence of several sensitive organs at risk (OAR) that can be affected by radiation. I assessed two different methods for automating the segmentation process: an atlas technique and a deep learning neural network approach. I developed the data anaylsis pipeline and MATLAB code to calculate metrics to compare the contours generated by both methods. Additionally, I devised a novel method to prospectively evaluate the accuracy of automated segmentation as a knowledge-based quality assurance (QA) tool. The knowledge-based quality assurance tool showed promising results as a quantitative safety check for auto-segmentation models.

#### Summer 2022

I compiled off-rated limits into a fuel reload engineering report and presented to a nuclear power plant. Additionally, I developed a Python-based software tool to parse and convert customer design inputs to a stored data structure that could be fed into further anaylsis tools. I converted this to a successful executable to automate data transfer processes from Excel to analysis codes. I also wrote a userâ€™s manual for the executable and an extensive technical description to document the development of the Python code.
