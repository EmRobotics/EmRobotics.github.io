Introduction: Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is a vital therapeutic approach utilized for young patients suffering from central nervous system disorders such as medulloblastoma. The task of accurately outlining the treatment area is particularly time-consuming due to the presence of several sensitive organs at risk (OAR) that can be affected by radiation. This study aimed to assess two different methods for automating the segmentation process: an atlas technique and a deep learning neural network approach. Additionally, a novel method was devised to prospectively evaluate the accuracy of automated segmentation as a knowledge-based quality assurance (QA) tool.

Methods: Involving a patient cohort of 100, ranging in ages from 2 to 25 years with a median age of 8, this study employed quantitative metrics centered around overlap and distance calculations to determine the most effective approach for practical clinical application. The contours generated by two distinct methods of atlas and neural network were compared to ground truth contours approved by a radiation oncologist, utilizing 13 distinct metrics. Furthermore, an innovative QA tool was conceptualized, designed for forthcoming cases based on the baseline dataset of 100 patient cases. The formulation of this benchmark distribution was achieved by utilizing kernel density estimation (KDE) applied to the Hounsfield Unit (HU) distributions within the volume contained by the delineated contours. This tool enabled a comparative analysis between the generated contours from 10 test patients and the benchmark distribution derived from the 100 patient cases.

Results: The mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) across all organs of 100 patients was 0.66 ± 0.14 for the atlas method, while it stood at 0.73 ± 0.04 for the neural network approach. The calculated metrics indicated that, in the majority of cases (60.58%), the neural network method demonstrated a notably higher alignment with the ground truth. Instances where no difference was observed accounted for 31.25%, while utilization of the atlas method represented 8.17%. The QA tool results showed that the two approaches achieved over 75% agreements of over 75% in 65.6% of instances for the atlas method and in 82.5% of instances for the neural network auto-segmentation. Moreover, the methods achieved over 95% agreement in 43.8% of cases for the atlas method and in 59.4% of cases for the neural network.

Conclusion: The results indicate that the neural network approach showcases superior performance, evidenced by the higher DSC and its significantly closer physical alignment to ground truth contours in the majority of cases. The metrics derived from overlap and distance measurements have enabled the clinicians to discern the optimal choice for practical clinical application. A knowledge-based quality assurance tool has shown promising results as a quantitative safety check for auto-segmentation models.
