## Mars Rover
#### Fall 2022 

I have been involved in the [Michigan Mars Rover Team](https://mrover.org) for my entire undergraduate studies. The mission of our competition-oriented team is to build a rover capable of complex arm tasks, autonomous navigation, and scientific life detection, where we compete at the annual [University Rover Challenge (URC)](https://urc.marssociety.org).

In my first two years, I read academic papers to design and analyze life detection tests in soil samples, tested pH and nitrogen sensors, and **designed the funneling mechanism** to transfer the dirt to the chemical tests using CAD, which has been used in all subsequent rovers. I also trained on mill and lathe devices in order to **machine parts for the rover**.

In my third year, I was the **Astrobiology Lead**, where I oversaw the design and implementation of the science tests on the rover. At the start of my leadership position, our team competed for the first time at the [Canadian International Rover Competition (CIRC)](https://circ.cstag.ca). I led the preparation for the science testing, by overseeing testing method and strategy development. During the competition, I documented the habitability of a mapped area and developed a report with thorough analysis of our findings, which led us to a **1st place** win at the competition overall.

During the rest of my year as lead, I oversaw the system's preparation for URC, which included internal design reviews and creating a [System Acceptance Review video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKBLp-un0XE). Preparing involved **thoroughly testing the science system**, compiling a safety plan, and studying Mars missions and sedimentary geology. During the competition, I lead the **soil collection and rock identification tasks**, and at the end of the competition, I presented with one other person to competition judges on our findings during the mission and answered questions relating to astrobiology and Mars missions.

In my current role as the **Astrobiology Senior Advising Member**, I'm working on a **in-house designed and built Raman spectrometer** to identify signs of both extinct and extant life, aligning the laser, and researching key aspects for this year's competition, including soil structure and habitability considerations.

My Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Critical Design Review (CDR) slides can be found below. Additionally, the report that was created during the CIRC competition is below as well.

## RADical Robotics
#### Fall 2022 and Winter 2023

Radiation detection robots could play a crucial role in identifying radiation hotspots in nuclear power plants during routine leakage detection and emergency responses, as well as in various defense applications, such as border control and or potential nuclear fallout. By introducing radiation detection robots, our project team aimed to reduce health risks for human operators, lessen their physical demands, and enhance efficiency in surveying challenging and high-risk areas. RADical Robotics **developed a radiation detection robot** utilizing a Rosbot Robot Car, a high-resolution H3D M400 CZT gamma-ray spectrometer, and the Robot Operating System (ROS).

As one aspect of characterizing the localized source or sources, my personal design goal was to **determine the isotopes present** based off of a gamma energy spectra. I created a **Python processing script** that input a data file from the detector containing counts per energy channel information, and output a plot of the energy spectrum with identified peaks and the identified isotope(s). I developed an algorithm to compare the found peaks in the spectrum with an isotope database I cultivated. My algorithm met the **IAEA National Standard Identification Criteria (N42.34)** for isotope identification and background false alarm rate requirements.

## Space design
#### December 2022

I played a crucial role in our team project focused on designing a nuclear-powered spaceship for a one-way journey to Saturnâ€™s moon Titan, aimed at establishing an outer-heliosphere science and refuel hub for deep space mission, with a mission duration of under 20 years and a minimum three-person crew. Within this ambitious endeavor, my responsibilities revolved around the critical aspect of **designing a life support system**. Leveraging research and knowledge of current life support technologies, I contributed by proposing a comprehensive life support system that **incorporated bioregenerative life support principles** derived from exploring past algae experiments. I proposed algae growing chambers and gravity designs to meet mission requirements. This important facet of our mission was aimed at ensuring the well-being and survival of the crew throughout the extended journey to aim for mission success!

## Environmental Service Project
#### Winter 2020

In collaboration with two team members, I conducted hands-on fieldwork, collecting samples from local beaches and **meticulously characterizing microplastics using optical microscopy**. Furthermore, I transformed my research findings into a **compelling environmental awareness film**, which not only demonstrated my dedication to scientific outreach but also earned me the 1st place award in the 9th-12th grade State of Michigan Earth Day Environmental Service Award competition. This experience underscores my passion for making a positive impact on our planet.
