I'm a curious and energetic Nuclear Engineering student studying at the [University of Michigan](https://ners.engin.umich.edu), and I'm seeking opportunities in the nuclear field to make the world a better place.

I grew up in a rural part of Michigan surrounded by the beauty of nature, which motivated my strong love for the environment. Nuclear energy was a great fit for me as a way to promote a carbon-free future, and also satisfy my fascination for physics. Ever since I read a chapter on nuclear physics in high school, I have been intrigued by the world of the atom and the astonishing laws of physics that govern it.

I have experience coding, doing research, and working in the nuclear energy industry and hospital environment. I have a growing interest in applying my knowledge of physics to the field of medicine and exploring fields such as medical physics, nuclear medicine, and plasma medicine.

Brief Biography
======

I have done a summer of **measurement research** with Dr. Zhong He in the [Orion Radiation Measurement Group](https://cztlab.engin.umich.edu) where I worked with thallium bromide (TlBr) semiconductor crystals and wrote MATLAB algorithms to investigate how the crystals changed over time. 

I then worked with Dr. John Foster in the [Plasma Science and Technology Lab](https://pstlab.engin.umich.edu) on **low temperature plasma research** where I documented the design and started building a plasma reactor that could destroy high concentrations of PFAS in a water purification system. I also studied the impacts of background effects on the plasma created by a gridded ion thruster. 

I spent a summer doing **pediatric oncology research at St. Jude Children's Reseach Hospital** with [Dr. Ozgur Ates](https://www.stjude.org/directory/a/ozgur-ates.html) where I evaluated contours of commercial deep learning and atlas-based auto-segmentation models for craniospinal irradiation in pediatric proton therapy.

I'm currently the **Astrobiology Senior Advising Member on the [Michgian Mars Rover Team](https://mrover.org)** where I am developing a Raman spectrometer and designing life detection testing suites for the detection of amino acids, lipids, and chlorophyll on-board the rover.

I have taken **Radiation Therapy Physics, the Physics of Medical Imaging, and Computational Physics** as well as many other Nuclear Engineering classes as preparation for a Medical Physics PhD program.
