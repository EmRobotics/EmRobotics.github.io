I'm a curious and energetic Nuclear Engineering student studying at the [University of Michigan](https://www.engin.umich.edu/), and I'm seeking opportunities in the nuclear field to make the world a better place.

I grew up in a rural part of Michigan surrounded by the beauty of nature, which motivated my strong love for the environment. Nuclear energy was a great fit for me as a way to promote a carbon-free future, and also satisfy my fascination for physics. Ever since I read a chapter on nuclear physics in high school, I have been intrigued by the world of the atom and the astonishing laws of physics that govern it.

I have experience coding, doing research, and working in the nuclear energy industry. I have a growing interest in applying my knowledge of physics to the field of medicine and exploring fields such as medical physics, nuclear medicine, and plasma medicine.

What I'm Doing Now
======

Maybe talk about current research here

Science lead

Current course work 

Talk about St Jude



Preparing for my **summer internship at NASA JPL** where I'll be working on the simulation stack for the Mars Sample Return mission. 

I'm the **software lead for Michigan Autonomous Aereal Vehicles (MAAV)** where we design, program, and test software code for a completely autonomous on-board flight system. Our team is competing in the IARC international competition this year and plans on running flight tests this summer! 

I'm an **iOS Lead for Michigan Hackers**. Michigan Hackers is the largest Computer Science club on campus with over 150 active members. On the iOS subteam, we work to teach, develop, and deploy iOS apps using Xcode and swift. Check out some of the cool projects we've worked on in the Projects tab!

I'm currently a **teaching assistant for EECS 482 -- Operating Systems** which is an intense computer science course where students impliment large C++ projects including: their own thread library, virtual memory pager, and networked computer file system.
