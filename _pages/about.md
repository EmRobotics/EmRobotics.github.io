I'm a curious and energetic Nuclear Engineering student studying at the [University of Michigan](https://www.engin.umich.edu/), and I'm seeking opportunities in the nuclear field to make the world a better place.

I grew up in a rural part of Michigan surrounded by the beauty of nature, which motivated my strong love for the environment. Nuclear energy was a great fit for me as a way to promote a carbon-free future, and also satisfy my fascination for physics. Ever since I read a chapter on nuclear physics in high school, I have been intrigued by the world of the atom and the astonishing laws of physics that govern it.

I have experience coding, doing research, and working in the nuclear energy industry. I have a growing interest in applying my knowledge of physics to the field of medicine and exploring fields such as medical physics, nuclear medicine, and plasma medicine.

What I'm Doing Now
