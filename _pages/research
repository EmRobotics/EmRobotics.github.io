Thallium bromide (TlBr) semiconductor research
======
## [Orion Radiation Measurement Group](https://cztlab.engin.umich.edu)
### Summer 2021


where I worked with thallium bromide (TlBr) semiconductor crystals and wrote MATLAB algorithms to investigate how the crystals changed over time. 

I then worked with Dr. John Foster in the [Plasma Science and Technology Lab](https://pstlab.engin.umich.edu) on **low temperature plasma research** where I documented the design and started building a plasma reactor that could destroy high concentrations of PFAS in a water purification system. I am currently studying the impacts of background effects on the plasma created by a gridded ion thruster.
