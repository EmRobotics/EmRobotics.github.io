## Gridded ion thruster research
### [Plasma Science and Technology Lab](https://pstlab.engin.umich.edu)
#### Fall 2022 and Winter 2023

Junior year in Dr. Foster's lab, I worked on **grid ion thruster research** with a PhD student. The goal of the project was to determine how the background effects of the vacuum chamber impact the plasma created by the ion thruster and the neutralization of the thruster. I **built Langmuir probes** to take measurements inside the vacuum chamber, which are used to investigate the background plasma and the plasma created by the ion thruster. Additionally, I worked on some of the wiring that connects necessary components and allowed for the ion thruster to turn on and for measurements to be taken. I also worked on **writing Python scripts** that automate a process where probes moved around the chamber and took measurements continuously as they swept across different positions.

## Water purification research
### [Plasma Science and Technology Lab](https://pstlab.engin.umich.edu)
#### Winter 2022

In 2022, I was working on a **plasma water purification project** with a PhD student. The goal was to build a plasma reactor that could destroy high concentrations of PFAS in a water purification system. I **modeled a previous reactor reservoir using CAD**, so a new reservoir could be machined. I constructed the frame of the reactor and **documented the dimensions and setup of the parts**. Additionally, I created solutions of differing conductivities that were used to investigate how plasma characteristics changed in different environments. I used the data from spectrometer measurements at differing conductivities to create intensity spectra of the light emitted.

## Thallium bromide (TlBr) semiconductor research
### [Orion Radiation Measurement Group](https://cztlab.engin.umich.edu)
#### Summer 2021

The summer after my freshman year, I worked at the University of Michigan with Dr. Zhong He in the Orion Radiation Measurement Group. I worked with thallium bromide (TlBr) semiconductor crystals which can be used as gamma-ray spectrometers. I conducted a series of experiments, adjusting voltage and other settings, collecting data on the **response of crystals to Cs-137 sources**. I monitored these measurements over time to optimize the collection settings and determine how the performance of the crystals was changing with increased use. Additionally, I wrote algorithms to **characterize the crystal data** and create graphs for **TlBr crystal analysis** using MATLAB, contributing to a more thorough understanding of the TlBr crystals' behavior and performance characteristics.
