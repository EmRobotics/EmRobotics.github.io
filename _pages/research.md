## Gridded ion thruster research
### [Plasma Science and Technology Lab](https://pstlab.engin.umich.edu)
#### Fall 2022 and Winter 2023

This year in Dr. Foster's lab, I have been working on grid ion thruster research with another PhD student. The goal of the project is to determine how the background effects of the vacuum chamber impact the plasma created by the ion thruster and the neutralization of the thruster. I built several Langmuir probes to take measurements inside the vacuum chamber, which are used to investigate the background plasma and the plasma created by the ion thruster. Additionally, I worked on some of the wiring that connects necessary components and allows for the ion thruster to turn on and for measurements to be taken. Currently, I am working on writing Python scripts that automate a process where probes move around the chamber and take measurements continuously as they sweep across different positions.

## Water purification research
### [Plasma Science and Technology Lab](https://pstlab.engin.umich.edu)
#### Winter 2022

Last year, I was working on a water purification project with a PhD student. The goal was to build a plasma reactor that could destroy high concentrations of PFAS in a water purification system. I modeled the reactor reservoir using CAD. I constructed the frame of the reactor and documented the dimensions and setup of the parts. Additionally, I created solutions of differing conductivities that were used to investigate how plasma characteristics changed in different environments. I used the data from spectrometer measurements at differing conductivities to create intensity spectra of the light emitted.

## Thallium bromide (TlBr) semiconductor research
### [Orion Radiation Measurement Group](https://cztlab.engin.umich.edu)
#### Summer 2021

The summer after my freshman year, I worked at the University of Michigan with Dr. Zhong He in the Orion Radiation Measurement Group. I worked with thallium bromide (TlBr) semiconductor crystals which can be used as gamma-ray spectrometers. I ran experiments with the TlBr crystals at certain voltages and other settings to detect a Cs-137 sources. I took these measurements over time to determine how the performance of the detector was changing. I wrote algorithms to characterize the crystal data and create graphs for TlBr crystal analysis using MATLAB.
